# MERN-Project
MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.

ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

I created a simple To-Do and deployed it to MERN stack. I wrote a frontend application using React.js that communicates with a backend application written using Expressjs. I also created a Mongodb backend for storing tasks in a database.

I launched an EC2 Instance and added the necessary security groups with ubuntu server and ssh with keypair to connect to Ubuntu Server OS.
